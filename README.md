Notes:
* This was written over two days and evolved naturally. No guarantees it makes sense.
* Clone with submodules.
* RStudio doesn't like my `this.dir` construction in R. You may need to comment out / modfiy it.

Run order:

* `tidy_1.R`
* `tidy_2.R`
* `tidy_3.py`
* `tidy_4.R`
* `opr_1.py`
* `opr_2.R`
